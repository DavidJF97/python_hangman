# Python Hangman

Python Hangman is a python terminal based game of Hangman. The player is presented with a hidden word and must fill in the blanks and guess the word before they run out of attempts and the stick figure is hung, signalling game over.

The live website, hosted on Code Institute mock terminal can be visited [here](https://python-hngmn.herokuapp.com/)
